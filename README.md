# Spring 2018 INF553 - HW1
This assignment aims to get familiar with Spark and analyze bigdata using Spark. The datasets are from Amazon Product data, including the data of individual product category: Toys and Games ratings and the metadata of the products. The programs calculate average rating of each product and each brand.

## Environment Requirements
* Java: 1.8
* Scala: 2.11.12
* Spark: 2.2.1 

## Installation
This installation is for Mac OS X.

Open your terminal, install sbt 1.1.0:
  `brew install sbt`
  
Download the Spark 2.2.1 with Hadoop 2.7 fromï¼š http://spark.apache.org/downloads.html
  
## Datasets
For Task1, only dataset1 is required. And for Task2, both dataset1 and dataset2 is required.
* Dataset1:  _reviews_Toys_and_Games.json_, please decompress the folder after downloading.
http://snap.stanford.edu/data/amazon/productGraph/categoryFiles/reviews_Toys_and_Games_5.json.gz
* Dataset2: _metadata.json_, please decompress the folder after downloading.
http://snap.stanford.edu/data/amazon/productGraph/metadata.json.gz

## Code Example
Testing first requires Open your terminal, using `.bin/rspark-submit --class <main-class> <application-jar> [application-arguments]` in the top-level Spark directory to launch the applications. The program only allows absolute path to access the file. Please don't access to an unexisting file or directory, especially for the output file.

For example,

* Task1
  
 ` .bin/spark-submit --class task1 path/to/Tong_Lyu_task1.jar absolute_path/to/reviews_Toys_and_Games.json absolute_ path/to/Tong_Lyu_task1.csv`
* Task2 

 ` .bin/spark-submit --class task2 path/to/Tong_Lyu_task2.jar absolute_path/to/reviews_Toys_and_Games.json path/to/metadata.json absolute_path/to/Tong_Lyu_task2.csv`
